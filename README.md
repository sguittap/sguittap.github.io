<h1> How to play</h1>

<body>
  <h2><p>First select your Hero with the LEFT and RIGHT buttons. Once you have your desired Hero, click SELECT.
  There are five Heroes to choose from.
    Each Hero has stats that will determine the outcome of an attack.</p>
  <p>When you select your Hero, a random enemy Hero will present itself from the selectable Heroes.</p>
  <p>Click a direction to attack the enemy and the enemy will respond with theirs. If your attacks match, they will cancel each other out and no damage will be dealt. Damage will be dealt when attack directions do not match. You have the option to evade, but can be defeated with a TOP attack.</p>
  <p>Each time an attack is initiated, the dice are rolled for skill damage and speed damage. If skill roll is successful, the Hero deals damage negating enemy defense. If speed roll is successful, the Hero deals double damage. Keep in mind, these all can be dodged</p></h2>
